## UX 
The project is a graphical user interface of a website quiz. Through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript it demonstrates my programming knowledge.

## User Stories
* A progress bar to provide visual feedback to the user with information about how many questions are left;
* A toggle button so the user can decide whether the sound is on or off;
* A scoretrack system;
* Choose a nickname to be shown on the leaderboard.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The colour palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

### Wireframes
To create the wireframes I used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/). It helped me visualize the design before I started to build the website.

### Typography
There are 3 different fonts being used on the website. The combination was generated by the [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) website and the font style is from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* [Monoton](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Monoton) was used for the title of the game;
* [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Merriweather+San) for the homepage and the questions;
* [Viga](https://fonts.google.com/?query=viga) for the final page and leaderboard;
* [Amiko](https://fonts.google.com/?query=amiko) for the buttons;
* [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/?query=dancing+script) for the "Thank you" page.

The icon on the last page and the leaderboard are from [Font Awsome](https://fontawesome.com/) and the favicon is from [FontIcon](https://gauger.io/fonticon/).

## Features
### Existing Features
The quiz game question bank holds 50 questions at the moment. When a user starts the game, the code will select ten questions at random. So every time a user begins a game, they will never be in the same order or questions. After finishing the quiz, the user will get to choose a nickname to be shown with the total score at the leaderboard.
