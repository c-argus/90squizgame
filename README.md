## UX 
#
The project is a graphical user interface of a website quiz. Through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript it demonstrates my programming knowledge.

### User Stories
#
* A progress bar to provide visual feedback to the user with information about how many questions are left;
* A sound button so the user can decide whether is on or off;
* A scoretrack system;
* Choose a nickname to be shown on the leaderboard.

## Design

### Wireframes
To create the wireframes I used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/). It helped me visualize the design before I started to build the website.
